PEG.js Benchmark Suite
======================

This is the PEG.js benchmark suite. It measures speed of the parsers generated
by PEG.js on various inputs. Its main goal is to provide data for code generator
optimization.

Running
-------

  1. Start a web server and make it serve the PEG.js root directory (one level
     up from this one).

  2. Point your browser to an URL corresponding to the index.html file.

  3. Wait for the table to fill :-)

If you have Python installed, you can just run the following command in the
PEG.js root directory

  python -m SimpleHTTPServer

and load http://localhost:8000/benchmark/ in your browser.
